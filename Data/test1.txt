Morwenna Gump was thinking about David Raymond again. David was a hungry banker with red toenails and short arms.

Morwenna walked over to the window and reflected on her sunny surroundings. She had always loved sleepy Exeter with its wicked, wide waters. It was a place that encouraged her tendency to feel active.

Then she saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a hungry figure of David Raymond.

Morwenna gulped. She glanced at her own reflection. She was a daring, remarkable, beer drinker with sticky toenails and fragile arms. Her friends saw her as a knotty, knowing knight. Once, she had even saved a teeny-tiny old lady that was stuck in a drain.

But not even a daring person who had once saved a teeny-tiny old lady that was stuck in a drain, was prepared for what David had in store today.

The snow flurried like bouncing hamsters, making Morwenna barmy. Morwenna grabbed a tiny torch that had been strewn nearby; she massaged it with her fingers.

As Morwenna stepped outside and David came closer, she could see the dirty glint in his eye.

David gazed with the affection of 7812 charming keen kittens. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want a kiss."

Morwenna looked back, even more barmy and still fingering the tiny torch. "David, I admire your eyebrows," she replied.

They looked at each other with ambivalent feelings, like two oily, old owls singing at a very kind snow storm, which had drum and bass music playing in the background and two tactless uncles smiling to the beat.

Morwenna regarded David's red toenails and short arms. "I feel the same way!" revealed Morwenna with a delighted grin.

David looked relaxed, his emotions blushing like a red, rich record.

Then David came inside for a nice drink of beer.
