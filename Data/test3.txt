Simon Gump had always loved chilly Cardiff with its bloody, boiled beaches. It was a place where he felt sneezy.

He was a modest, helpful, cocoa drinker with ugly ankles and feathery fingernails. His friends saw him as a careful, combative carer. Once, he had even helped a resonant kitten recover from a flying accident. That's the sort of man he was.

Simon walked over to the window and reflected on his idyllic surroundings. The wind blew like dancing lizards.

Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Cuthbert Platt. Cuthbert was a popular god with curvaceous ankles and charming fingernails.

Simon gulped. He was not prepared for Cuthbert.

As Simon stepped outside and Cuthbert came closer, he could see the fierce glint in his eye.

Cuthbert gazed with the affection of 4837 cute scary snakes. He said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want justice."

Simon looked back, even more delighted and still fingering the tiny rock. "Cuthbert, I'm in love with you," he replied.

They looked at each other with jumpy feelings, like two ratty, rapid rats dancing at a very intelligent rave, which had jazz music playing in the background and two forgetful uncles sitting to the beat.

Simon studied Cuthbert's curvaceous ankles and charming fingernails. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm sorry," began Simon in apologetic tones, "but I don't feel the same way, and I never will. I just don't love you Cuthbert."

Cuthbert looked concerned, his emotions raw like a gifted, grisly gun.

Simon could actually hear Cuthbert's emotions shatter into 8549 pieces. Then the popular god hurried away into the distance.

Not even a mug of cocoa would calm Simon's nerves tonight.
